## Lego Mindstorms EV3
This project was a school project that I did in a team that consisted of 4 members including me.
In this project we had to program Lego Mindstorms robot to go through a obstacle track. The track had a black line that the robot followed and when the robot noticed that there were an obstacle it went around it
